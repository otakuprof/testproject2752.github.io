You have encountered some built-in functions , which are functions that python has already defined and provided to you to use. 1 2 3 4 5 a = 3.142 print(a) type(a) b = int(a) c = str(a) Run the following statements in your IDE to see what the built-in functions, round() and abs() do. 1 2 3 4 5 a = -3.142 b = round(a,1) c = abs(c) print(b) print(c) Consider the following questions. - How many inputs does the round() function require? - At which line(s) do you execute the print() function? - At which line(s) do you execute the abs() function? Using the math library It is possible to use functions from a module . In the following example, we show you how to use 1 2 3 4 import math y = math . sqrt ( 2 ) z = math . sin ( 1 ) #arguments to trigonometric functions are in radians print ( y , z ) It is possible for you to import only one function from the module. The following example illustrates. 1 2 3 from math import sqrt y = sqrt ( 2 ) print ( y ) Defining Your Own Function It is possible for you to define your own functions. Consider the following example. 1 2 3 4 5 6 def quadratic_equation ( x ): y = x ** 2 + 5 * x + 4 return y s = quadratic_equation ( 1 ) print ( s ) Lines 1 to 3 contain the function definition . A function definition defines the statements to be executed when it is called. It is like a set of instructions that is ready to be executed. Line 1 contains the function header . It begins with the def keyword , followed by the name of the function. Lastly, it takes in one input called x . The last character of the function header must always be a colon : . The body of the function is contained in lines 2 and 3. Notice that they are indented four spaces. In python, this indentation is important, and shows that the statements are part of the function. Line 2 contains one statement that is executed by the function. Here, in this case, some calculations happen with x and the result is assigned to the local variable y . At line 3, the function has a return statement. The function terminates, and returns the value of y to the caller. Comparing with real life A function is a set of instructions that are carried out when called or executed . Suppose you have a set of instructions written down on a piece of paper called make soft boiled eggs . Make soft-boiled eggs Boil about 500 ml of water in a metal container After the water boils, place two eggs in the container Retrieve eggs after 7 minutes One day, you take the piece of paper and proceed to actually boil the eggs. Consider, in python: -which part of this story is like the function definition? -which part of this story is executing the function? Lesson Proper Recall the parts of a function Cohort Problems Problem 2.01 compound_interest( r, n) This function takes in the interest rate of r and the number of periods n and returns the value of $$f$$ as defined by the following formula. You can assume that n is never zero, and inputs to the function will always be int or float . It is not necessary to round the output. $$ \\begin{equation} F = \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{n} \\right)^n \\end{equation} $$ Test cases: 1 2 print ( compound_interest(0.03, 1) ) print ( compound_interest(0.12 ,12) ) gives the following output: 1 2 1.03 1.1268250301319698 Problem 2.02 bmi(weight,height) This function takes in the weight in kilograms and height in centimetres, and returns the Body Mass Index (BMI), rounded to one decimal place. The BMI can be calculated by taking the weight in kilograms and dividing it by the square of the height in meters. You can assume that the height is never zero, and inputs to the function will always be int or float . Use the round() function. Test cases: 1 2 3 print ( bmi ( 60 , 120 ) ) print ( bmi ( 50 , 150 ) ) print ( bmi ( 43.5 , 142.3 ) ) gives the following output: 1 2 3 41.7 22.2 21.5 Homework Problems Problem 2.11 to be determined","title":"Lesson 2"},{"location":"about/#lesson-2-functions","text":"","title":"Lesson 2 - Functions"},{"location":"about/#pre-reading","text":"","title":"Pre-Reading"},{"location":"about/#built-in-functions","text":"A function is a set of instructions that are carried out when called or executed.
